# HelsinkiCityBike
Fun project inspired from MOOC exercise in file handling

In this project, I write a function that process a file that has all stations' info  and show distance between two stations. 

There's an additional function that returns two stations on the given list with greatest distance from each other

Update: code works, running current status of file city_bikes.py will return:

which means the distance between Laivasillankatu station and Hietalahdentori in stations1.csv is the longest, at 1.4787 units of measurements (should be km)

Freely change the name of stations*.csv will change results accordingly
